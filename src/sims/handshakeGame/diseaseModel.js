 * What we are simulating:
 * Simulates a simple infection model in which people "pair off" in each round and then have a
 * percentage chance of infecting each other.
 *
 * What our model does:
 * To simulate pairing off:
 * - We start by shuffling the population into a new order.
 * - We then move through the population by two's (each two is a partner).
 * - We move their x/y coordinates so we can visually "see" them pairing in the simulation with
 *   one partner moving to the other.
 * - If one partner is infected and not the other, we have a chance of infecting the other.
 *
 * Note: We also keep track of people who are newly infected in each round so we can graph new infections
 * separately from total infections.
